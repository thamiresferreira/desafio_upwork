So I have a template picture (1080 by 1080 pixels) and I have a spreadsheet on excel filled with different sayings/quotes.
I need a python program that I can use to extract each line on the excel document and paste it on the template picture
and then generate a png or jpeg picture for each line in the excel file (so multiple pictures created instantly).

It needs to be able to
1. Change the color of the text
2. Change the font of the text
3. Change position of the text
4. Be able to create multiple images from the excel file in one go (I want it to be able to read the excel
file and then read the specifications listed above #1, 2 and 3 and then apply them to all the different lines of the excel
file in one go)


** The sayings/quotes in the excel file are going to be varying in length and so I want the program to be able
to resize it all and then fit it in a certain location that I want it to.

We can discuss price and please inlcude "PYTHON" at the beginning of your reply.
